Ubuntu template(s)
==================

If you would like to use Ubuntu Linux distribution in your AppVMs, you can build and install one of the available Ubuntu templates.
These templates are currently not provided by Qubes in ready to use binary packages, because Canonical does not allow redistribution of a modified Ubuntu.
The redistribution is not allowed by their [Intellectual property rights policy](https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/intellectual-property-policy).  

Install
-------

Templates can be built using [Qubes Builder](/doc/qubes-builder/).
You can also access its documentation in the [source code repository](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-builder/blob/master/README.md).

To quickly prepare the builder configuration, you can use the `setup` script available in the repository - it will interactively ask you which templates you want to build.  
On the "Choose Pre-Built Packages Repositories" you must not select either option. This is because Qubes does not provide offical Pre-Built packages for Ubuntu.  
Then, in the qubes-builder directory, run:
```
make qubes-vm
make template

```

The build for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial) is straightforward.

The build for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic) is straightforward.
