filter issues depending on your interest and experience. For example, here are
some common issue labels:

Before you engage in an activity that will take you a significant amount of
time, like implementing a new feature, it's always good to contact us first,
preferably via the [qubes-devel] mailing list. Once we've worked out the
details, we'll add you to our [Community-Developed Feature Tracker]. We'll then
be grateful to [receive your patch][patch].
